<h3>Mr Amrit Man Shrestha, passed on 10 March 2013 - (29 Falgun 2069 BS).</h3>

	community.

<p>
	He had a strong support for knowledge and even at his 
	age, he was upto date wth the modern thoughts. He set an example by treating 
	all of his children equally. There was no partiality between his sons and daughters.
